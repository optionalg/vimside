Vim

=================================================

=================================================

This is the pre-alpha release of Vimside (Vim Scala IDE).
Vimside is built upon the ENSIME server:
github: https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime
manual: http://aemoncannon.github.com/ensime/index.html

I have checked the source into github primarily so that
the source is somewhere other than on my local machines.
I expect to continue to update the sources on github
on a pretty reason rate, flushing out the features.

Vimside communicates with the Ensime server using 
Shougo vimproc ( git://github.com/Shougo/vimproc ),
a very clean and elegant C-language binding to sockets
(and also pipes, ptys, files, etc.).
Vimside also uses Shougo vimshell to launch and communicate with
the Scala Repl.

The current pre-alpha has only be run against the Ensime
pre-built ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1.tar.gz download.

install details
=================================================

Currently, the zip file on www.vim.org is, basically,
empty; its a place holder. 
To install one must get the source from github
[githup](http://github.com/megaannum/vimside).


If as a developer, one wants fixes as they appear, one can clone the 
github {Vimside} repository and, as updates appear, copy the files
over to you Vim home location.

Vim has a number of third-party plugin managers. If you are using one
you can configure it to automatically download and install {Vimside}.

After unpacking the Vimside directory layout should look like:

    $HOME/.vim/
      autoload/
        vimside.vim
        vimside/
          " vimside code
      data/
        " data that persists between invocations of a plugin
        vimside/
            " examples, local test scala/java source tree
      doc/
        vimside.txt
      plugin/
        vimside.vim

Intalling with vim-addon-manager (VAM)

For more information about vim-addon-manager, see [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager) and [Vim-addon-manager getting started](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt)

In your .vimrc, add self as shown below:

    fun SetupVAM()

      ...

      let g:vim_addon_manager = {}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources = {}

      ....

      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['self'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/self'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['forms'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/forms'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimproc'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/Shougo/vimproc'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimshell'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/Shougo/vimshell'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimside'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/vimside'}


      let plugins = [
        \ 'self',
        \ 'forms',
        \ 'vimproc',
        \ 'vimshell',
        \ 'vimside'
        \ ]

      call vam#ActivateAddons(plugins,{'auto_install' : 0})

      ...

    endf
    call SetupVAM()

Note that to use Vimside, the 'self' and 'forms' libraries above are
optional. With the 'forms' library, Vimside supports additional 
features such as a popmenu of commands and the type and package inspectors
(not yet implemented).

Now start Vim. You will be asked by vim-addon-manager 
if you would like to download and install the plugins.

In addition, for ENSIME, there are pre-built releases available at:
https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/downloads.
I highly recommend getting these (Scala 2.9.2 and/or 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT)
rather than trying to build the Ensime Scala code yourself.


Installing with pathogen:
I do not use pathogen. An example usage would be welcome.
